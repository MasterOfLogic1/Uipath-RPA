A sample RPA process. It's an FX processing Bot. It reads an excel containing transactions and determines if a customer transaction would be profitable for the FX company.

It achieves this by checking the exchange rate against an online fx app. if the transaction is profitable the customer gets an email that their transaction is successful.

Finally the fx processor gets and email and attachment of all transactions whether successful or failed
