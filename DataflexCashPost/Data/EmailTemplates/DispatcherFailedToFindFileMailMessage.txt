I would Not proceed with this process because of Input file related issues.

A valid input file should be placed in the DataflexCashPosting Stroage Bucket.This file must be an excel containing the following headers {"supplementnumber","period","clientnumber","contractcode","checknumber","totaladjustmentamount","co-pay"}.

The file name should look like (CheckNumber_PayDate.xlsx) where Pay date must be in date format MMddyyyy and file extension must be (.xlsx or.xls). i.e 103923227
_02292024.xlsx would be a file containing transactions for check number  103923227 to be posted on 29th February 2024.

Don't worry the headers are not case sensitve and spaces in the header names do not affect the bot
